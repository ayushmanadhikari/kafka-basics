Producer
#producer has 2 parts: captain and user
#captain produces certain data and sends it to broker every 1 minute
#user sends its data everytime it needs to do booking. But for this project we will produce user data every 3 minute
#to distinguish the data we can populate them into different partitions
#these data are sent to a single topic
#you can set the event type to distinguish between the message produced by the captain or the user



Consumers
#it consumes the data every 5 minutes by distinguishing between the demand and supply
#store this is a database of your choice
#it then uses the location-data in that database to plot the graph between demand and supply
