Kafka 101 O'Riely

Messages and Batches
-unit of data within Kafka is called message
-message can have optional peice of metadata referreed as key
-for efficiency messages are written into Kafka in batches
-batch is a collection of messsages having same topic and partition
-larger the bacth, the more messages can be handled per unit of time but the longer it takes an individual message to propagate


Schemas
-additional structure or schema is imposed on the message content so that it can be easily understood
-example: XML, JSON: easy to handle and human-understandle but lack robust type handling and compatibility between schema versions
-many favour Apache Avro which provides compact serialization format and strong typing and schema evolution.. with both backward and forward compatibility
-consistent data format is important in Kafka


Topic and Partitions
-messages are catgorized into topics
-topics further broken down into paritions
-a topic has multiple paritions 
-message-ordering is not guranteed in 
cross- paritions but only within a single parition
-each parition can be hosted on a different server
-single topic can be scaled horizontally 
-paritions can also be replicated
-most often, a stream is considered to be a single topic of data, regardless the number of paritions 


Producers
-create new messages
-message produced to a specific topic
-by default, producer doesn not care what parition a specififc message is written to
-but you can change that


Consumers
-read messages in a certain topic
-read messages in to order they were produced 
-consumer keeps track of which messages it has already consumed by keeping track of the offeset of messages
-offset, is an integer value that continually increases, is another piece of metadata that kafka adds to each message as it is produced
-each message is given a parition and has unique offset
-this offset is required when recovering from failure

-consumers work as part of a consumer group.. for a paritcular topic
-the group assures that each parition is only consumed by one member
-one consumer can also handle more than one paritions but one parition is handled by only one consumer
-if one consumer fails, the remaining members of group will rebalance 



Brokers and Clusters
-a single kafka server is called a broker
-broker recieves messages from producers, assigns offsets to them and commits the message to storage on disk
-it also serves consumers responsding to gfetch request with the messages that have been committed to disk
-kafka brokers are designed to work as part of the cluster
-one broker will act as master
-one partition is owned by a single broker in the cluster called leader/master of the parition
-a parition can be assigned to multiple brokers resulting in replications
-individual topics can be configured with their own retention settings(either retention for x days or retention until y GB)

-kafka project includes a tool called MirrorMaker used for replicating data to other clusters
